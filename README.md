# ProfitableCPMRate

ProfitableCPMRate is an automated script designed to track impressions, clicks, and revenue for a specific ad campaign using proxies and browser-like headers. It simulates traffic and clicks to generate data and optimize revenue for a given URL.

This project includes:
- Proxy rotation from a list of HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies.
- Simulated click behavior to generate impressions and calculate metrics.
- A markdown report that logs performance metrics like CTR, CPM, and revenue.
- Graphical representations of the metrics over time.

## Features

- **Automated Proxy Rotation**: Uses a rotating proxy list to simulate traffic from various sources.
- **Simulated Clicks**: Randomized click generation to simulate user interaction and revenue generation.
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks impressions, clicks, CTR, CPM, and revenue.
- **Markdown Reports**: Provides a detailed report of metrics over time.
- **Graphical Visualizations**: Displays graphs of impressions, clicks, and revenue over time.
- **Scheduled Execution**: Can be run every 10 minutes using GitHub Actions for continuous performance tracking.
